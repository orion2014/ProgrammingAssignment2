## The following couple of functions will calculate the inverse of a matrix
## The inverse will be cached so that it can be retrieved in case of need.

## This function cretes a matrix that can store its inverse into a cache 
## and gives the user a method to retrieve it

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

   
}


## This function will search the cache for an inverse of the matrix "x"
## if the function is found in the cache, then this function will return the vaules stored in the cache
## otherwise, the cache will be calculated.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
